## Code Difference From Previous Chapter
For reference, you can check what all code changes we are going to do in this chapter from [here](https://github.com/shripalsoni04/angular2-tutorial-app/compare/step-6...step-7). 

As this chapter has so many code addition/changes, I have created four separate commits with name starting with Step 7.1 to 7.4. You can see all these commits in top panel of comparison link that I mentioned above. Click on any of that and you will be able to see code diff of each sub commits.

If you haven't written all the code shown in previous chapters or have stuck somewhere, checkout code till now by executing below command.
```
git checkout step-6
```

Let's start developing form to add/edit project details.
