# Getting Started
We will create a **Project Management App** to understand all the building blocks of Angular 2.

This app implements below functionalities.
- Dashboard showing active projects to quickly edit them
- Project listing with filter and a readonly detail view of the project
- Ability to add, update and delete project using in-memory data store
- Client-side form validation
- Routing between various application states
- Material design implementation

The final output of the application is as shown below:

We will create this application step-by-step and with each step you will understand some concepts of Angular 2.

We will be creating this application using Typescript. So let's take a quick look at typescript first.

## Typescript Introduction
Typescript is a typed superset of javascript, which compiles to plain javascript. The type system of typescript is optional. That means, any valid javascript is also a valid typescript and we can use both of them in one project. Using typescript, we can use many features of ES6 right now and typescript is committed to implement all the features of future ECMAScript versions also.

## Why To Use Typescript
Development experience of angular 2 with typescript is very good. Some aspects of angular 2 like dependency injection can be implemented with ease using type annotation of typescript. Source code of angular 2 is also written in typescript, so we are assured that we will have good development experience while using typescript. For large javascript projects, typescript is the best transpiler to use as we can detect any static code error at the time of compilation rather than at runtime. 
Also by using an IDE with good support of typescript, we can use features like code intellisense, code refactoring and code navigation in typescript files.
You can get more information of typescript and supported IDEs at http://www.typescriptlang.org

Now, let's start building our sample Project Management Application.

## Step 1: Environment Setup
We need to have below things setup before we start the project. Ignore the things from below which are installed on your machine.

### Install Node
Download nodejs from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ as per on your OS and install it. It will also install npm (node package manager)

### Download/Use IDE With Good Typescript Support
As in this tutorial, we are going to use typescript to create our application, it will be very helpful if you use an IDE with good typescript support. I personally prefer [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as it has very good typescript support, it is lightweight, has good plugin system, open source and seems promising.

### Install Typings Globally
[Typings](https://github.com/typings/typings) provides a way to install typescript definitions in such a way that it satisfy the typescript compiler. 

While developing using typescript, when we use code of any library which is written in javascript, typescript will give compilation error as it will not be able to find what it is. Though, it will produce valid javascript code. But, why to keep such compilation error, if we can solve it.Right? 

To remove such compilation error, we need to install definition file of that library. Typescript definition files end with .d.ts extension. So `Typings` helps us to install such typescript definition files and satisfies typescript compiler.

To install any typescript definition file, we need to install `Typings` CLI first. To install `Typings` CLI globally execute below command from your command prompt/terminal:
```
npm install typings --global
```
Great!. We are now ready to create our first Angular 2 app.

## Step 2: Project Setup
First, execute below command to clone the **Project Management App** repository in any directory.
```
git clone https://github.com/shripalsoni04/angular2-tutorial-app.git
```

Once the project is cloned, go to that directory
```
cd path/to/directory/angular2-tutorial-app
```

Now, checkout step-0 tag
```
git checkout step-0
```

Install development and runtime dependencies of the project by executing below command
```
npm install
```

If everything goes right, run the project by executing below command
```
npm start
```

This command will start typescript compiler in watch mode and after that it will start the application. Go to 
http://localhost:3000 and you should see output as shown below:
```
Welcome To Project Management App
```

After this step, your project's directory structure should be as shown below:

![Directory structure after projectsetup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shripalsoni04/angular2-tutorial/master/images/0-Intro/0_1-directory-structure.png)

Now, let's understand what all that folders/files mean.

`tsconfig.json`

This file specifies configuration for typescript compiler. Explanation of these compiler options of typescript is not in scope of this tutorial. If you want to get more details of these compiler options, you can check that out at http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html


`typings.json`

This file is used to maintain the typescript definition files that are installed in the project. Whenever you execute command like `typings install moment --save`,  it will add an entry of that in this file. The actual `.d.ts` files are stored in `typings` folder.

`package.json`

This file keeps track of development and runtime dependencies for the project. All the dependencies are installed in `node_modules` folder. We can also write scripts that we want to execute in this file (e.g `npm start` that we used above). 

To run the angular 2 project, below packages needs to be installed:
```
 "dependencies": {
    "angular2": "2.0.0-beta.9",
    "systemjs": "0.19.24",
    "es6-promise": "^3.0.2",
    "es6-shim": "^0.33.3",
    "reflect-metadata": "0.1.2",
    "rxjs": "5.0.0-beta.2",
    "zone.js": "0.5.15"
 }
```
Here,

- **angular2** : Angular 2 framework files
- **systemjs**: It is a universal module loader, which is used to load es6 modules that we write in angular 2 application. More info at https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs
- **es6-promise**: This is a polyfill of es6 promise. More info at https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise
- **es6-shim**: This provides compatibility of es6 promise implementation for legacy browsers.
- **reflect-metadata**: Polyfill for Metadata Reflection API, which is proposed standard for ES7 along with decorators.
- **rxjs**: Reactive extension for js. Angular 2 requires this to be loaded as it is being used internally also. We will look into this in our tutorial in future chapters. For more information, go to https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS
- **zone.js**: Used by angular 2 internally for change detection.

This file is loaded first in the browser. Here, note that the sequence of scripts should be as shown above to run the angular 2 application properly.

That brings the end of this chapter. In next chapter, we will learn how to bootstrap an angular 2 application.
