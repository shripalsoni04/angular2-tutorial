## Introduction
If you have noted in previous chapter that even though we had applied mdl classes to our filter textfield, it did not have material design effect. In this chapter we will make that textfield materialized. Also, in project detail section, we will show client detail in popover on click of info icon besides client name. By implementing this, we will learn below angular 2 concepts:
- What is directive?
- How to create custom attribute directive
- Use of ngOnDestroy lifecycle hook

## Code Difference From Previous Chapter
For reference, you can check what all code changes we are going to do in this chapter from [here](https://github.com/shripalsoni04/angular2-tutorial-app/compare/step-4...step-5).

If you haven't written all the code shown in previous chapters or have stucked somewhere, checkout code till now by executing below command.

## What is Directive?
Directive is a marker on DOM element (element, attribute or special syntax `*`), which tells angular to attach behaviour to the DOM element or alter the behaviour of DOM element or change the structure of the element and its children.

In angular 2 there are three types of directives.
1. Component Directive
2. Attribute Directive
3. Structural Directive

Till now the components that we created, all are a kind of directive. Component directive is the only directive which accepts templateUrl/template.

Attribute directive adds/alters the behaviour of the DOM element or change the appearance of the element. [`ngStyle`](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/common/NgStyle-directive.html) and [`ngClass`](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/common/NgClass-directive.html) are the built-in attribute directives. We will create custom attribute directives in this chapter.

Structural Directives changes layout by adding or removing DOM elements. [`*ngFor`](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/common/NgFor-directive.html), [`*ngIf`](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/common/NgIf-directive.html) and [`ngSwitch`](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/common/NgSwitch-directive.html) are the built-in structural directives. We will rarely need to create our own custom structural directive. So creating a custom structural directive is out of scope for this tutorial. If you are interested in creating your own structural directive, you can get more information [here](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/structural-directives.html#!#unless).

Now let's create custom attribute directive in next sections.
