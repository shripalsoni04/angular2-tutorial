# Create Custom Attribute Directive
In this section we will create two attribute directives. One to materialize our filter textfield and second to show contact details in popover. In this section you will learn below angular 2 concepts:
- How to create attribute directive
- Use of jQuery in directive
- Use of ngOnDestroy lifecycle hook of component/directive
- Event binding using `host` property in directive metadata

First, let's create a simple directive to materialize any element.
## Materialize Element Directive
### Step1 : Write Minimal Code Of Directive
Programmatically directive is a class decorated with `@Directive` decorator. So let's create a basic structure of the directive first.

> All the code, that we want to share among other modules, we will write them in 'shared' directory. So first create 'shared' directory inside your app directory.

**app/shared/materialize-element.directive.ts**
```tyepscript
import {Directive, ElementRef} from 'angular2/core';

@Directive({
    selector: '[materializeElement]'
})
export class MaterializeElementDirective{
    
    constructor(el: ElementRef){
    }
}
```

This is the minimal code that you will mostly require to write to create any custom attribute directive. Let's understand it.

In first line, we imported `Directive` decorator and annotated our class with it. This is similar to what we did for component or pipe in previous chapters.

As we are creating an attribute directive, we have written attribute selector `'[materializeElement]'` in selector property of Directive metadata.

We also imported `ElementRef`. This is a service class, which gives access to the element on which we have put our attribute directive. And then we referred it in constructor `constructor(el: ElementRef){}` as a type annotation.  For now consider that  by annotating `ElementRef` as type in constructor, we are telling angular to inject instance of `ElementRef` using its dependency injection. We will learn more about dependency injection in next chapter.

### Step 2: Write Code To Materialize Element
In this step, we are not going to write any angular specific code. We are just going to call a method of mdl library to materialize the element.

**app/shared/materialize-element.directive.ts**
```typescript
import {Directive, ElementRef} from 'angular2/core';

@Directive({
    selector: '[materializeElement]'
})
export class MaterializeElementDirective{
    
    constructor(el: ElementRef){
            this._upgradeElement(el.nativeElement);
    }
    
    /**
     * Upgrades dom element to material dom element
     */
    private _upgradeElement(ele: HTMLElement){
        componentHandler.upgradeElement(ele);
    }
}
```

> Material design lite library do not have support of upgrading elements which are dynamically added into DOM. In our application we are injecting component dynamically and not on page load, so the elements with mdl classes won't have any effect. We need to manually upgrade all such element once the component is created. Note that in future, we will remove use of this directive, as we will use a directive to upgrade whole DOM of component rather than one element.

### Step 3: Use Directive In Component
Now we have created an attribute directive, let's register it in our component and use it in template.

**app/projects-list.component.ts**
```typescript
import {MaterializeElementDirective} from '../shared/directives/materialize-element.directive';

@Component({
    ...
    directives: [MaterializeElementDirective]
})
 export class ProjectListComponent{
    ...
}

```

**app/projects/projects-list.component.html**
```html
<div class="mdl-textfield mdl-js-textfield mdl-textfield--floating-label" id="filterProjects" materializeElement>
    ...
</div>
```

We have created a working simple attribute directive.

## Popover Directive
Now, let's start creating a popover directive to show client details step-by-step

### Step 1: Install jQuery
As we are going to do some DOM manipulation to implement this directive, it will be good to use jQuery for cross browser compatibility and ease of use (Also, one purpose to use jQuery is to show that we can use any third party library in directive without any issue). So first install jquery and import it in index.html:

```
npm install jquery --save
```

Install type definition file by executing below command:
```
typings install jquery --ambient --save
```

**index.html**
```html
<script src="node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script>
```

### Step 2: Create Popover Directive
To show any content in popover, we need to pass template and title to this directive as input. Let's start creating this directive.

**app/shared/directives/popover.directive.ts**
```typescript
import {Directive, ElementRef, Input, OnInit, OnDestroy} from 'angular2/core';

@Directive({
    selector: "[popover]"
})
export class PopoverDirective implements OnInit, OnDestroy {

    @Input() template: any;

    @Input() title: String;

    isVisible: boolean = false;

    constructor(private _elementRef: ElementRef) { }
    
    private _getPopoverEle() {
        return $(this._elementRef.nativeElement).next();
    }
    
    /**
     * Returns popover card template structure
     */
    private _getPopoverCardTpl() {
        return `<div class="mdl-card mdl-shadow--8dp popover">
                    <div class="mdl-card__title">
                        <h2 class="mdl-card__title-text">${this.title}</h2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="popover-content"></div>
                </div>`;
    }
    
    /**
     * Adds popover element to dom tree
     */
    private _preparePopoverEle() {
        var $nativeEle = $(this._elementRef.nativeElement);
        $nativeEle.wrap('<span style="position: relative;"></span>');
        var $popoverEle = $(this._getPopoverCardTpl()).css('left', $nativeEle.width() + 5 + 'px');
        $nativeEle.after($popoverEle);
        $popoverEle.hide();
    }
    
    /**
     * Body click event handler which closes popover on click of body element 
     * excluding popover element and its trigger element
     */
    private _bodyClickHandler(event: JQueryEventObject) {
        var $popoverEle = this._getPopoverEle();
        if (event.target !== this._elementRef.nativeElement 
            && $(event.target).parents('.popover')[0] !== $popoverEle[0]) {
            this.hidePopover();
        }
    }

    private _listenBodyClick() {
        $('body').on('click', this._bodyClickHandler.bind(this));
    }

    private _removeBodyClickListener() {
        $('body').off('click', this._bodyClickHandler);
    }
    
    showPopover() {
        this.isVisible = true;
        var $popover = this._getPopoverEle();
        $popover.find('.popover-content').html(this.template.innerHTML);
        $popover.show();
    }

    hidePopover() {
        this.isVisible = false;
        var $popover = this._getPopoverEle();
        $popover.hide();
    }

    ngOnInit() {
        $(this.template).hide();
        this._preparePopoverEle();
        this._listenBodyClick();
    }

    ngOnDestroy() {
        this._removeBodyClickListener();
    }
}
```
Stat understanding code from `ngOnInit` method. We will not go in detail of any logic of this directive. But we will focus only the things which are new for us.

#### ngOnDestroy Lifecycle Hook
From previous chapters, we already know that component/directive provides many lifecycle hooks. We have already understood `ngOnInit` hook method, which is called once all the input properties of the component are initialized. In this directive, we have also used `ngOnDestroy` hook method, which will be called as its name suggests, on destruction of the component. 

As in `ngOnInit` method, we have attached click event listener on body to close the popover on click of body, to avoid memory leakage, we need to remove this event listener on destruction of the component. For this purpose `ngOnDestroy` is the best way provided by angular. So, `ngOnDestroy` is mostly used to free up any resources or event listeners to avoid memory leaks.

### Step 2: Show Popover On CLick Of Element
In step 1, we created the popover directive, but we didn't write any code to show popover. Now let's take that up. We want to show the popover on click of the element where this directive is used. Let's add code to fulfill this requirement.

**app/shared/directives/popover.directive.ts**
```typescript
@Directive({
    ...
    host: {
        '(click)': 'togglePopover($event)'
    }
})
export class PopoverDirective implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
    ...
    togglePopover(event: MouseEvent) {
        event.stopPropagation();
        if (this.isVisible) {
            this.hidePopover();
        } else {
            this.showPopover();
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

In above we code, we introduced `host`. Let's understand it.

#### host
In angular, the element on which the directive is attached is called `host` element. Now, to open the popover we need to attach a click event listener on the element. We can do that in the PopoverDirective class, but if we write there, we need to remember to remove that event listener on component destruction. To make this stuff easy to use and to know what all events are handled by the directive at once, angular has `host` property in directive metadata. 

So, when we write `host: {'(click)': 'togglePopover($event)'}` in directive metadata, angular will automatically attach click event listener and will call togglePopover whenever the click event is triggered on the element. On component destruction, angular will also automatically remove this click event listener. Note that, you can specify any valid DOM event here.

### Step 3: Use Popover In ProjectDetailComponent
We have created a nice popover directive, now let's use it in template of ProjectDetailComponent by registering it with the component.

**app/projects/project-detail.component.ts**
```typescript
import {PopoverDirective} from '../shared/directives/popover.directive';

@Component({
    ...
    directives: [PopoverDirective]
})
export class ProjectDetailComponent{
...
}
```

**app/projects/project-detail.component.html**
```html
...
<div class="project-detail-container">
    <div class="mdl-grid">
        <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--6-col">
            <dl>
                <dt>Client Name</dt>
                <dd>{{project.client?.name}}
                     <button class="mdl-button mdl-button--icon mdl-js-button mdl-js-ripple-effect" 
                        popover [template]="clientDetailTpl" [title]="'Client Details'">
                        <i class="material-icons">info</i>
                    </button>
                    <div #clientDetailTpl>
                        <div class="mdl-grid">
                            <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--6-col">
                                <dl>
                                    <dt>Timezone</dt>
                                    <dd>{{project.client?.timezone}}</dd>
                                </dl>   
                            </div>
                            <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--6-col">
                                <dl>
                                    <dt>Country</dt>
                                    <dd>{{project.client?.country}}</dd>
                                </dl>   
                            </div>
                            <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--6-col">
                                <dl>
                                    <dt>Email</dt>
                                    <dd>{{project.client?.email}}</dd>
                                </dl>    
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </dd>
            </dl>
        </div>
        ...
    </div>
</div>
...
```

In above template code, note the use of local template variable `#clientDetailTpl` and how we are passing input to the directive. We are using `#clientDetailTpl` to refer to the template in input property binding `[template]="clientDetailTpl"`. 

This brings the end of directive chapter. In next chapter we will explore services and dependency injection.
