# Introduction
In this chapter, we will add a new dashboard screen which will show all the active projects with a link to edit the project. As there are two different screens, we need to implement some way to navigate between the two. For that we will implement routing using angular's router library. Currently, in edit mode, the form is opening besides the list only. But, as we are going to provide edit link from dashboard also, it will be good if we create a separate screen for project form. This gives us ability to bookmark/share a particular project form for edit. By implementing these functionalities, we will understand below angular 2 concepts:
- How to configure routes
- How to navigate between routes
- How to pass parameters while navigating
- Lifecycle hooks of router

## Code Difference From Previous Chapter
For reference, you can check what all code changes we are going to do in this chapter from [here](https://github.com/shripalsoni04/angular2-tutorial-app/compare/step-7...step-8). 

As this chapter has so many code addition/changes, I have created five separate commits with name starting with Step 8.1 to 8.5. You can see all these commits in top panel of comparison link that I mentioned above. Click on any of that and you will be able to see code diff of each commits.

If you haven't written all the code shown in previous chapters or have stuck somewhere, checkout code till now by executing below commands.
```
git checkout step-7
npm install
```

Let's start implementing routing in this chapter.
