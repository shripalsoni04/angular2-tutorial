# Configure Routes
In this section, first we are going to create a dashboard component and then we will setup and configure routes for navigation between dashboard and projects screens.

Let's start development of that.

## Step 1: Create Dashboard Component
In dashboard component we will show list of the active projects and add provision to edit that project from there. Let's add that component.

**app/dashboard/dashboard.component.ts**
```typescript
import {Component, OnInit} from 'angular2/core';
import {ProjectService} from '../projects/project.service';
import {Project} from '../projects/project.model';
import {MaterializeDirective} from '../shared/directives/materialize.directive';

@Component({
    selector: 'dashboard',
    templateUrl: 'app/dashboard/dashboard.component.html',
    directives: [MaterializeDirective],
    styles: [`
        .mdl-card{
            margin: 15px;
        }
        .mdl-card__title{
            height: 150px;
        }
    `]
})
export class DashboardComponent implements OnInit{
    
    activeProjects: Project[] = [];
    
    constructor(private _projectService: ProjectService){}
    
    loadActiveProjects(){
        this._projectService.getProjects().subscribe((projects)=>{
            this.activeProjects = projects.filter(project => !project.isCompleted);
        })    
    }
    
    ngOnInit(){
        this.loadActiveProjects();
    }
}
```

**app/dashboard/dashboard.component.html**
```html
<div class="dashboard-content-container mdl-grid" materialize>
    <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col">
        <h4>Active Projects</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="mdl-card mdl-shadow--4dp" *ngFor="#project of activeProjects">
        <div class="mdl-card__title mdl-color--indigo-300 mdl-color-text--accent-contrast">
            <h5>{{project.name}}</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="mdl-card__menu">
            <button class="mdl-button mdl-button--icon mdl-js-button mdl-js-ripple-effect mdl-color-text--accent-contrast">
                <i class="material-icons">mode_edit</i>
            </button>
        </div>
        <div class="mdl-card__supporting-text">
            {{project.client.name}}
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

There isn't anything new in above code. So let's move to next step.

## Step 2: Add Router Library
Router library is not bundled with angular core library as it is optional for some projects to use routing functionality. So we need to manually import that into our index.html
```index.html
...
<head>
    ...
    <script src="node_modules/angular2/bundles/router.dev.js"></script>
</head>
...
```

We need to set `href` attribute of `<base>` element in `<head>` of index.html to tell router how to compose navigation url. Let's add it.

```index.html
...
<head>
    ...
   <script>document.write('<base href="' + document.location + '" />');</script> 
</head>
...
```

In above code, we are setting base href to document root location, as we want to form urls as `http://domain.com/dashboard` or `http://doamin.com/projects`. 

## Step 3: Configure Routes
For proper navigation, we need to configure our routes first. So let's do it in our root component.

**app/app.component.ts**
```typescript
import {ROUTER_PROVIDERS, RouteConfig} from 'angular2/router';
import {DashboardComponent} from './dashboard/dashboard.component';
import {ProjectsComponent} from './projects/projects.component';

...

@RouteConfig([
    {path: '/', name: 'Dashboard', component: DashboardComponent, useAsDefault: true},
    {path: '/project/...', name: 'Projects', component: ProjectsComponent},
])
@Component({
    selector: 'pm-app'
    ...
     providers: [
        ROUTER_PROVIDERS,
        ...
     ]
})
export class AppComponent{
    ...
}
```

Let's understand above code to get to know how to configure routes.

First, we imported `ROUTER_PROVIDERS` providers and  `RouteConfig` decorator from `angular2/router` module. 

`ROUTER_PROVIDERS` is an array of providers related to  routing. As we are going to use `Router` service (configured in `ROUTER_PROVIDERS`) in whole application, it is good that we register `ROUTER_PROVIDERS` at root component so we don't need to register at all child components.

`RouteConfig` decorator in root component is used to configure all the top level routes of the application. 

In route configuration, 
- `path` is the url of the route.
- `name` is the route name which we will use for navigation among routes. 
- `component` is the root component for particular route. 
- `useAsDefault` indicates, in case of no route definition found, application should navigate to which route by default.

As we are going to use `ProjectService` in both of the screens, let's register it to root component instead of ProjectsComponent.

```typescript
import {ProjectService} from './projects/project.service';
...
@Component({
    ...
    providers: [
        ...
        ProjectService
    ]
})
export class AppComponent{

}
```

## Step 4: Configure Navigation Links In Template
We have configured the routes of the application, but where the content of the component, configured for a route, will be inserted. We need to specify it using `<router-outlet>` directive. Let's do it.

**app/app.component.html**
```html
...
<div class="page-content">
    <router-outlet></router-outlet>
</div>
...
```
`<router-outlet>` is a directive, which renders the component content inside it based on route. We added this directive in template, but we forgot to register this directive in component. As without doing that, it will not work. Let's do that now.

**app/app.component.ts**
```typescript
import {ROUTER_DIRECTIVES, ...} from 'angular2/router';
...

...
@Component({
    directives: [ROUTER_DIRECTIVES],
})
export class AppComponent{
    ...
}
```

Now, let's configure links to navigate between two routes.

**app/app.component.html**
```html
...
<nav class="mdl-navigation">
    <a class="mdl-navigation__link" [routerLink]="['Dashboard']" href="">Dashboard</a>
    <a class="mdl-navigation__link" [routerLink]="['Projects']" href="">Projects</a>
</nav>
...
```

`routerLink` is a built-in directive which helps in app navigation by routeName. As you can see in code [routerLink]="['Dashboard']" , we are passing RouteName in array. Why we passed array, that will be cleared in next section.

In next section, we will learn about child routes.
