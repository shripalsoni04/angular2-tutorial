# Introduction
In this chapter, we will learn how to bootstrap angular 2 application.

## Code Difference From Previous Chapter
For reference, you can check what all code changes we are going to do in this chapter from  [here](https://github.com/shripalsoni04/angular2-tutorial-app/compare/step-0...step-1).

Before we start with bootstrapping the angular 2 application, it is good that we know some of the terminologies of angular 2 that we will be using in this chapter.

## Decorator
Decorator is basically a javascript function, which alters/extends behaviour of the class/function/method/parameter. As decorator is a function, it can accept arguments. In angular 2, the building blocks like component, service, pipe etc. are just a class decorated with a relevant decorator. Decorator attaches metadata to the class, which tells angular how to proecess that class.

Decorator is a proposed standard for ES7. But as we are using typescript, we can use it right now. Decorator starts with `@` symbol. Commonly used decorators in angular 2 app are as listed below:
- @Component
- @Injectable
- @Directive
- @Pipe
- @Input
- @Output
- @RouteConfig

We will understand all these decorators in this tutorial.

## Module
A module is a group of related code. We can export some class/functions out of it and we can import the exported class/function or whole module in it. Angular 2 application is made by combining such modules. This module is nothing but an ES6 module. 

To export a class from a module

**app.component.ts**
```
export class AppComponent{ ... }
```

Now, if we want to use this class in some other module, we need to import it

**main.ts**
```
import {AppComponent} from 'app.component'
```

This much information of module is sufficient to get started with angular 2. You can google `es6-module` and `class` for more information.

## Component
Component is just a plain ES6 class decorated with `@Component` decorator. It can be considered as a group of view template and a class which handles application/view logic. Angular 2 application is a hierarchy of such components as shown below:
![Application Component Hierarchy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shripalsoni04/angular2-tutorial/master/images/1-Bootstrap/1_1-component-hierarchy.png)

Component sample code:
```
@Component({
    selector: 'app',
    templateUrl: 'app/template.html'
    directives: [],
    providers: []
})
export class AppComponent{
...
}
```
We will look into the details of the component configurations/metadata (selector, templateUrl etc.) whenever it is used in this tutorial.
