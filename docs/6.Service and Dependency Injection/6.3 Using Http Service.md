# Using Http Service
Currently we have hardcoded projects data in ProjectService. But in real app this data will be coming from some backend api server. In this section, we will remove the project data from service and we will fetch it using Http service with the help of  a2-in-memory-web-api. After completion of this section, you will know below angular 2 concepts:
- How to use Http Service
- Introduction to RxJS

## Step 1: Install a2-in-memory-web-api and import http library
As we want to use Http service to fetch project data over http, but we don't have any api server with us right now. So to emulate http request, we will use [a2-in-memory-web-api](https://github.com/wardbell/a2-in-memory-web-api) library. Let's install it first by executing below command:

```
npm install a2-in-memory-web-api --save
```

After installation, import that library into our index.html file. Also as http implementation is not bundled with angular2 dev package, we need to load it separately.

**index.html**
```html
<script src="node_modules/angular2/bundles/http.dev.js"></script>
<script src="node_modules/a2-in-memory-web-api/web-api.js"></script>
```

## Step 2: Create In Memory Data Service Class
The in-memory web api gets its data from a class with a createDb() method that returns a "database" object whose keys are collection names ("projects") and whose values are arrays of objects in those collections. Let's create this class.

**api/in-memory-data.service.ts**
```typescript
export class InMemoryDataService {

    createDb() {
        let projects = [
            {
                id: 1,
                name: 'Project 1',
                client: {
                    id: 1,
                    name: 'Client 1',
                    timezone: 'PST',
                    country: 'USA',
                    email: 'client1@domain.com'
                },
                details: 'Project 1 Description',
                isCompleted: false,
                startDate: 1451606400000,
                endDate: 1456770600000,
                employees: [
                    { id: 1, name: 'Employee 1', role: 'FrontEnd Developer', email: 'emp1@domain.com' },
                    { id: 2, name: 'Employee 2', role: 'BackEnd Developer', email: 'emp2@domain.com' },
                    { id: 3, name: 'Employee 3', role: 'Tester', email: 'emp3@domain.com' },
                    { id: 4, name: 'Employee 4', role: 'Project Manager', email: 'emp4@domain.com' }
                ]
            }, {
                id: 2,
                name: 'Project 2',
                client: {
                    id: 2,
                    name: 'Client 2',
                    timezone: 'IST',
                    country: 'India',
                    email: 'client2@domain.com'
                },
                details: 'Project 2 Description',
                isCompleted: true,
                startDate: 1433097000000,
                endDate: 1436898600000,
                employees: [
                    { id: 4, name: 'Employee 4', role: 'Project Manager', email: 'emp4@domain.com' },
                    { id: 5, name: 'Employee 5', role: 'FullStack Developer', email: 'emp5@domain.com' }
                ]
            }, {
                id: 3,
                name: 'Project 3',
                client: {
                    id: 3,
                    name: 'Client 3',
                    timezone: 'CET',
                    country: 'Germany',
                    email: 'client3@domain.com'
                },
                details: 'Project 3 Description',
                isCompleted: true,
                startDate: 1438367400000,
                endDate: 1444415400000,
                employees: [
                    { id: 2, name: 'Employee 2', role: 'BackEnd Developer', email: 'emp2@domain.com' },
                    { id: 3, name: 'Employee 3', role: 'Tester', email: 'emp3@domain.com' },
                    { id: 4, name: 'Employee 4', role: 'Project Manager', email: 'emp4@domain.com' }
                ]
            }, {
                id: 4,
                name: 'Project 4',
                client: {
                    id: 4,
                    name: 'Client 4',
                    timezone: 'AEST',
                    country: 'Australia',
                    email: 'client4@domain.com'
                },
                details: 'Project 4 Description',
                isCompleted: false,
                startDate: 1456770600000,
                endDate: 1464719400000,
                employees: [
                    { id: 1, name: 'Employee 1', role: 'FrontEnd Developer', email: 'emp1@domain.com' },
                    { id: 3, name: 'Employee 3', role: 'Tester', email: 'emp3@domain.com' },
                    { id: 4, name: 'Employee 4', role: 'Project Manager', email: 'emp4@domain.com' }
                ]
            }];

        return { projects };
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Register in-memory-web-api To Use It
We need to tell angular to direct its http requests to in-memory-web-api rather than remote server. Let's do it.

**app/app.component.ts**
```typescript
import {Component, provide} from 'angular2/core';
import {XHRBackend, HTTP_PROVIDERS} from 'angular2/http';
import {InMemoryBackendService, SEED_DATA} from 'a2-in-memory-web-api/core';
import {InMemoryDataService} from '../api/in-memory-data.service';
...

@Component({
    ...
    providers: [
        HTTP_PROVIDERS,
        provide(XHRBackend, {useClass: InMemoryBackendService}), 
        provide(SEED_DATA, {useClass: InMemoryDataService})
    ]
})
export class AppComponent{
    ...
}
```

As angular delegates task of client/server communication to helper service `XHRBackend`, we can replace default `XHRBackend` with `InMemoryBackendService` of a2-in-memory-web-api library. This is the power of angular 2 dependency injection. We can alter the dependency value without affecting any code which is using it. Here, we also set our `InMemoryDataService` to `SEED_DATA` provider for mock data. Note that, we also registered `HTTP_PROVIDERS` here, as we are going to use `Http` service throughout the application.


## Step 4: Use Http Service In ProjectService Class
Now, we have all things setup for http request simulation, let's use Http service in ProjectService class to get list of projects.

**app/projects/project.service.ts**
```typescript
...
import {Http, Response} from 'angular2/http';
import {Observable} from 'rxjs/Rx';
import {Project} from './project.model';

@Injectable()
export class ProjectService {

    url: string = 'api/projects';

    constructor(private _http: Http) {}

    getProjects() {
        return this._http
            .get(this.url)
            .map(res => <Project[]>res.json().data)
            .catch(this._handleError);
    }
    
    private _handleError(error: Response) {
        // in a real world app, we may send the error to some remote logging infrastructure
        // instead of just logging it to the console
        console.error(error);
        return Observable.throw(error.json().error || 'Server error');
    }
}
```

In above code, we injected `Http` service in constructor to use it and then used it in `getProjects` method. Here, new stuff is `map`, `catch` and `Observable`. Let's understand that stuff.

`_http.get` method returns an Observable of HTTP Responses (Observable<Response>) from the RxJS library and `map` is one of the RxJS operators. As observables are used majorly in angular code, we imported RxJS library in index.html in our Getting Started chapter. RxJS is a third party library which implements [asynchronous observable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHI0AzD_WfY).

In above code, We used the Observable `catch` operator. It takes an error handling function with the failed Response object as the argument. Our service handler, `_handleError`, logs the response to the console, transforms the error into a user-friendly message by calling `error.json().error`, and returns the message in a new, failed observable via Observable.throw.

In code `.map(res => <Project[]>res.json().data)`, you can see that we are not getting the result array directly, but we are calling `res.json()` because, angular Http follows ES6 response object standard of Fetch function. `res` is a byte data, which will be converted to json on calling `.json()` call. And we are calling `.data` on that json, to get the array of result. There is a common convention to wrap the array inside an object for security reasons, which a2-in-memory-web-api follows.

You can get more information about RxJs [here](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS)

## Step 5: Refactor ProjectListComponent to Use Observable
As ProjectService's `getProjects` method is returning an observable, we need to refactor our code in ProjectListComponent. Let's do it.

**app/projects/projects-list.component.ts**
```typescript
...
export class ProjectListComponent{
    
    loadProjects(){
        constructor(private _projectService: ProjectService){}
        
        this._projectService.getProjects().subscribe((projects) => {
            this.projects = projects;
            ...
        });
    }
}
```

We need to `subscribe` to the observable returned by `getProjects` method, so whenever the result comes, success handler of subscriber will be called and in that we have assigned the results to `projects` property.

In most of the cases, we will be using `map` , `catch` operator of the rxjs and we will be subscribing to the observables.

There is also provision to fallback to use `Promise` instead of `Observable`. You can get more information about it [here](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/server-communication.html#!#fall-back-to-promises) .

## Step 6: Add Methods For CRUD Operation of Project
As in future we will create/update/delete project, it will be good if we add that methods now. Also we will be requiring get methods of Client and Employee service so add that also.  As there is nothing new, I am not going to cover it here. You can copy code of the same from [here](https://github.com/shripalsoni04/angular2-tutorial-app/commit/a24c19f5239c228baf40c7fb00b57aad738a1b6b). Also copy dummy data of Employee and Client from [here](https://github.com/shripalsoni04/angular2-tutorial-app/blob/251482b38538d87675ab285bbcf2f6d829964c87/api/in-memory-data.service.ts)

This brings the end of chapter on Service and Dependency Injection.
