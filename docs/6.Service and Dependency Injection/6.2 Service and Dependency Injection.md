# Service and Dependency Injection
If you remember, in ProjectsListComponent we hardcoded the list of projects value. In future, we have plans to use the data of project list in dashboard component also. So we need to somehow create a provision to share the data of list of projects among two components. In this section we will do that refactoring and by doing this we will understand below angular 2 concepts:
- How to create a Service
- How to use Service in Component
- What is injector, and how dependency injection works.


Let's start refactoring our code.

## Step 1: Write Minimal Project Service Code
Programmatically, service is a class and it is mostly annotated with `@Injectable` decorator. Let's create such service.

**app/projects/project.service.ts**
```typescript
import {Injectable} from 'angular2/core';

@Injectable()
export class ProjectService {

}
```

Let's understand above code.
First, we imported `Injectable` decorator and decorated our ProjectService class with it.  Let's understand `@Injectable` decorator.

### @Injectable Decorator
`@Injectable` decorator is the requirement of typescript to get dependency injection work in Service. When one service depends on another service like below example:
```typescript
import {Injectable} from 'angular2/core';
import {Service2} from 'service2';

@Injectable()
export class Service1 {
    constructor(private _service2: Service2){ }
}
```
If we don't decorate our class with `@Injectable` class, angular will not be able to inject `Service2` in `Service1`. Because without decorator, while compiling typescript file to javascript, typescript will just remove all the type annotations. So to let typescript know that this type annotation is used for dependency injection and to let it emit metadata for Service, we need to decorate our Service class with `@Injectable` decorator.  

If a service is not dependent on any other service, we can omit `@Injectable` decorator. But, in future we may required to add dependency of other services in such service, so it is good to always decorate a service with `@Injectable` decorator.

## Step 2: Add Method To Get Projects List
Let's add a method in ProjectService class, which will return a list of projects.
**app/projects/project.service.ts**
```typescript
import {Injectable} from 'angular2/core';

@Injectable()
export class ProjectService {
    getProjects() {
        return [{
            id: 1,
            name: 'Project 1',
            client: {
                id: 1,
                name: 'Client 1',
                timezone: 'PST',
                country: 'USA',
                email: 'client1@domain.com'
            },
            details: 'Project 1 Description',
            isCompleted: false,
            startDate: 1451606400000,
            endDate: 1456770600000, 
            employees: [
                {id: 1, name: 'Employee 1', role: 'FrontEnd Developer', email: 'emp1@domain.com'},
                {id: 2, name: 'Employee 2', role: 'BackEnd Developer', email: 'emp2@domain.com'},
                {id: 3, name: 'Employee 3', role: 'Tester', email: 'emp3@domain.com'},
                {id: 4, name: 'Employee 4', role: 'Project Manager', email: 'emp4@domain.com'}
            ]
        },{
            id: 2,
            name: 'Project 2',
            client: {
                id: 2,
                name: 'Client 2',
                timezone: 'IST',
                country: 'India',
                email: 'client2@domain.com'
            },
            details: 'Project 2 Description',
            isCompleted: true,
            startDate: 1433097000000,
            endDate: 1436898600000, 
            employees: [
                {id: 4, name: 'Employee 4', role: 'Project Manager', email: 'emp4@domain.com'},
                {id: 5, name: 'Employee 5', role: 'FullStack Developer', email: 'emp5@domain.com'}
            ]
        },{
            id: 3,
            name: 'Project 3',
            client: {
                id: 3,
                name: 'Client 3',
                timezone: 'CET',
                country: 'Germany',
                email: 'client3@domain.com'
            },
            details: 'Project 3 Description',
            isCompleted: true,
            startDate: 1438367400000,
            endDate: 1444415400000, 
            employees: [
                {id: 2, name: 'Employee 2', role: 'BackEnd Developer', email: 'emp2@domain.com'},
                {id: 3, name: 'Employee 3', role: 'Tester', email: 'emp3@domain.com'},
                {id: 4, name: 'Employee 4', role: 'Project Manager', email: 'emp4@domain.com'}
            ]
        },{
            id: 4,
            name: 'Project 4',
            client: {
                id: 4,
                name: 'Client 4',
                timezone: 'AEST',
                country: 'Australia',
                email: 'client4@domain.com'
            },
            details: 'Project 4 Description',
            isCompleted: false,
            startDate: 1456770600000,
            endDate: 1464719400000, 
            employees: [
                {id: 1, name: 'Employee 1', role: 'FrontEnd Developer', email: 'emp1@domain.com'},
                {id: 3, name: 'Employee 3', role: 'Tester', email: 'emp3@domain.com'},
                {id: 4, name: 'Employee 4', role: 'Project Manager', email: 'emp4@domain.com'}
            ]
        }];
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Use Project Service In ProjectListComponent
As we have moved data of projects to a separate service, let's remove it from ProjectsListComponent and use Project service instead.

**app/projects/projects-list.component.ts**
```tyepscript
...
import {ProjectService} from './project.service';
...
export class ProjectListComponent{
    ...
    constructor(private _projectService: ProjectService){
        
    }
    
    loadProjects(){
        this.projects = this._projectService.getProjects();
    }
    
    ...
}

```
Now, if you run the project, angular will give an error: 'Provider for ProjectService not found'. This is because we haven't registered a provider of ProjectService anywhere yet.

So, let's register provide in next step.

## Step 4: Register Service Provider
We can register service provider in component, as shown in below code:

```tyepscript
...
import {ProjectService} from './project.service';
@Component({
    ...
    providers: [ProjectService]
})
export class ProjectListComponent{
    ...
    constructor(private _projectService: ProjectService){
        
    }
    ...
}
```

Now if we run the application, the component will have an instance of ProjectService. Let's understand what is happening here.

We just assigned `[ProjectService]` to `providers` property of component metadata. Here, `[ProjectService]` is a shorthand for `[provide[ProjectService, {useClass: ProjectService}]]`, which is equivalent to `[new Provider[ProjectService, {useClass: ProjectService}]]`.

Both `provide` function and `Provider` class, takes two arguments. 
- First argument is a token. Service is registered with the injector with this token and whenever we want any service to be injected, we use this token to get it from injector. While writing component using typescript, we write the token as type annotation in constructor.
- Second argument is the provider definition object, which we can think of as recipe to create dependency value. We can use `useClass`, `useFactory`, `useValue` or `useExisting` as recipe. In this tutorial we will be using only `useClass` recipe.

In above explanation, a new term was coined : `Injector`. We can think `Injector` as a container of dependency values, that means it has mapping of token and its dependency value. In angular 2, each component creates a new injector. So like components, `Injector` are also hierarchical. When we pass any provider to `providers` property of component metadata, that provider will be registered with the component's injector. In case of Service, a new instance of it will be created whenever we assign it to `providers` array. 

So, if any child component asks for any dependency value, angular's dependency framework will first try to give it from that component's injector. If it don't find there, it will go up the hierarchy and try to get it from parent component's injector and go up till the root component. If it don't find at root component also, it will try to find it from app injector. We can register providers at the time of bootstrap `bootstrap(RootComponent, [...providers])`, which will register providers to app injector.

You can get more details of dependency injection from [here](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/dependency-injection.html).

## Step 5: Create Models and Interfaces for Entities
As we have plan to expand our project in future, it will be good that for better maintenance, we create models/interfaces for entities `Project`, `Client` and  `Employee`. Creation of models/interfaces is pretty simple and not related to angular, so I am not going to show it to you right now. You can write it yourself by checking it from https://github.com/shripalsoni04/angular2-tutorial-app/commit/a996a7be33fe8f2e7223da5807fb3d5d69547fa2
