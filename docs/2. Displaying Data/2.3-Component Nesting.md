# Component Nesting
In this section, we will learn how to use one component inside another.

We have plan to show selected project's details besides projects list in future. So it will be good if we create a container component which will contain two other components: projects-list component and project-detail component. This container component will handle communication between two child components in future.

Let's achieve above goal of creating container component step-by-step.

## Step 1: Write Minimal Projects Component
Let's write the basic scaffolding code of component.

**app/projects/projects.component.ts**
```typescript
import {Component} from 'angular2/core';

@Component({
    selector: 'projects',
    templateUrl: 'app/projects/projects.component.html'
})
export class ProjectsComponent{
}
```

**app/projects/projects.component.html**
```html
<div class="mdl-grid">
  <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--3-col">
  </div>
</div>
```

## Step 2: Insert Projects-list Component
Let's import and insert the projects-list component in this component.

**app/projects/projects.component.ts**
```typescript
...
import {ProjectListComponent} from './projects-list.component';

@Component({
    ...
    directives: [ProjectListComponent]
})
export class ProjectsComponent{
}
```
Here, one thing is new for us. 

We passed the imported project list component in directives option of component. In angular 2, if you use any component/directive in template of the component, we need to register it in directives option of component configuration. If we don't do it, angular will not parse that component/directive.

Now, let's insert the projects-list element in our projects component's template.

**app/projects/projects.component.html**
```html
<div class="mdl-grid">
  <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--3-col">
        <projects-list></projects-list>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Step 3: Insert Projects Component Inside App Component
Till now we have created project list component and inserted it inside projects component. But, how angular will render this projects component without specifying it in some template.

So, let's insert projects component inside our AppComponent.

**app/app.component.ts**
```typescript
...
import {ProjectsComponent} from './projects/projects.component';

@Component({
    ...
    directives: [ProjectsComponent]
})
export class AppComponent{}
```

**app/app.component.html**
```html
...
<div class="page-content">
    <projects></projects>
</div>
...
```

Now, run the application. You should be able to achieve the output as we saw in Introduction section of this chapter.

If you have stuck somewhere, just checkout the code of this chapter by executing below command:

git checkout step-2
